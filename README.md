# Programming Practice

This project was created to help practice for technical interviews. The sample code is written in C#.

The project generally follows "Introduction to Algorithms", Third Edition (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, & Stein), and throws in a few
other programming challenges that have been thrown at me during technical interviews.

## Workflow for Mastering a Technical Interview
* Think out loud so the interviewer can learn your thought process
* Resist the temptation to jump directly into coding
* Ask clarifying questions
  * Input ranges
  * Input sizes
  * Type of values in input (integer, floating point, etc.)
  * Expected size
  * Can the input contain zeroes?
  *Can the input contain duplicates?
  * Etc.
