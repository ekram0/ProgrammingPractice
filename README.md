# Programming Practice

This project was created to help practice for technical interviews. The sample code is written in C#.

The project generally follows "Introduction to Algorithms", Third Edition (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, & Stein), and throws in a few
other programming challenges that have been thrown at me during technical interviews.
